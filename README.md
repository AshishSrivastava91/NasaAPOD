### Why the cleaner approach?
1. Separation of code in different layers with assigned responsibilities making it easier for further modification.
2. High level of abstraction
3. Loose coupling between the code
4. Testing of code is painless
> Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. - by Michael Feathers”
